<h1>Blogger- React Native</h1>

<h2>Project Guidelines</h2><br>
<p>The aim for this project was to build a basic CRUD app using Context API and othe React hooks. User stories:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>I want to be able to see all my notes/blogs in on screen </li>
<li>I want to be able to create, update, and delete any of the posts easily </li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Approach</h2>
<p>For the front-end, I used React Native with expo starter package; for the front end, I used React hooks mainly instead of Redux </p><br>
<p>For the back-end, I used JSON Server API and ngrok to setup a local endpoint for CRUD operations </p><br>
